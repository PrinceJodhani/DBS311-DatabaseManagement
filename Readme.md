# DBS311 - Database Management - SENECA COLLEGE

<H4>
I am proud to announce my repository containing all my learnings from DBS311: Database Management at Seneca College. This repository showcases my journey of understanding the fundamentals of database design and management, and I am thrilled to share it with you. In addition to my coursework, this repository includes my database project and an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) that demonstrates my practical skills in this subject.

I hope that this repository serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in database management, and I welcome any feedback or suggestions.</H4>
